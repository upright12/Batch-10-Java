    // Object-Oriented Programming Concept
/* When we have variables and methods in the class
to use those we need object. so variables and methods
belongs to objects.

Class is a template/blueprint/prototype
---object is a real demonstration of that template

is Java 100% object-oriented Programming language?
No. because we have

1. static member (variable and method)
2. data type -- byte, int, short...
3. abstract class/Interface -- we cannot create an object


 */

    /*
    OOP has 5 principles

    1. Inheritance
Definition: it is a mechanism in which one objects acquires
all the properties and behaviour of the parent object.

    Single Inheritance = ClassB extends ClassA
  MultiLevel Inheritance = ClassB extends ClassA, ClassC extends ClassB
    heirarchial Inheritance= ClassB extends ClassA, ClassC extends ClassA
Hybrid Inheritnace = combination of heirarchial and multilevel
muiltiple Inheritance = ClassC extends ClassA, ClassB-- not possible in Java

    2. Polymorphism (method Overloading, method Overriding)-- many forms
    3. Abstraction (Abstract Class, Interface)
    4. Encapsulation
